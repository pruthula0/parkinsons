Parkinson's Disease Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of Parkinson's Disease using machine learning techniques. Parkinson's Disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system, and early detection can help in better management of the condition.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains voice measurements of people with and without Parkinson's Disease. Key features include MDVP (Microphone-Digital Voice Profile) parameters, fundamental frequency measures, and other vocal attributes.
